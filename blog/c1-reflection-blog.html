      <h1>Reflections on EDA Bootcamp style learning</h1>
    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
   <p> My point of view is skewed in that I already have a tech background. But I can say this.<br>
    Don't be scared, I know it sounds hardcore and you probably thought you'd never end up in a Bootcamp for programming, when you were in school.
    <br> let me tell you now, it is better that you can see the way the world is heading and that you are doing something about it now, than if you left it another 5 years.
    <br>Yes, you're a bit scared, but on the other side of fear is a state of elation and possibility that you can't fathom right now.
    All you need to do is keep putting one foot after the other </p>

    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
    <p>Lets do this!</p>
    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    <p>I have a Doer/For my Team mentality but at the same time, knowing the line between that and untracked emotional labour <br>ie I aint your mama can be hard. Generally I just keep an eye on my stress levels lol as they're a good indicator that I'm taking on more than I can handle</p>
    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
    <p>Not really, I've been watching and wanting to participate in EDA for a long time, itll be great that I can get into it finally!</p>
    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
    <p>Yes im excited and no im not nervous, sometimes nerves come from fear, there is no need to fear learning. </p>
